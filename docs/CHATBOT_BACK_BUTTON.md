# Chatbot Header Back Button Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ChatHeader Component (`components/ChatbotComponents.tsx`)

**Added:**

- `onBack` prop to `ChatHeaderProps` interface
- Back button with arrow-back icon on the left side of the header
- Conditional rendering of the back button (only shows if `onBack` prop is provided)

**Visual Changes:**

- Back button appears as a circular gray button with a back arrow icon
- Positioned to the left of the chatbot icon
- Consistent styling with the clear chat button

### 2. Updated Chatbot Screen (`app/(tabs)/chatbot.tsx`)

**Added:**

- Import for `router` from `expo-router`
- `handleBack` function that calls `router.back()`
- `onBack={handleBack}` prop passed to `ChatHeader` component

**Functionality:**

- When users tap the back button, they navigate to the previous screen
- Uses Expo Router's built-in back navigation functionality
- Maintains all existing chatbot functionality

## UI/UX Improvements

### Header Layout:

```
[Back Button] [Chatbot Icon] [Title & Status] [Online Indicator] [Clear Chat Button]
```

### Button Styling:

- **Back Button**: Circular gray background with dark gray arrow icon
- **Size**: 40x40 pixels (w-10 h-10)
- **Icon**: `arrow-back` from Ionicons
- **Color**: `#374151` (gray-700)
- **Background**: Light gray (`bg-gray-100`)

## Technical Details

### Props Interface:

```typescript
interface ChatHeaderProps {
  onClearChat?: () => void;
  onBack?: () => void;
}
```

### Navigation Function:

```typescript
const handleBack = () => {
  router.back();
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users can easily navigate back without using device back button
2. **Consistent Design**: Matches the app's overall design language
3. **Accessibility**: Clear visual indication of navigation options
4. **Flexibility**: Back button only appears when needed (when `onBack` prop is provided)

## Usage

The back button will automatically appear in the chatbot screen header and allow users to:

- Return to the previous screen they were on
- Navigate back through the app's navigation stack
- Maintain their place in the conversation (conversation state is preserved)

This implementation follows React Native and Expo Router best practices for navigation and maintains consistency with the existing app design.
